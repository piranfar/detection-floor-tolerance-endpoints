"""
Synthetic time-kill data generator.

WHY THIS EXISTS, STATED PLAINLY. The preprint's Figure 3 is captioned
"Experimental data vs. model fitting" but the paper names no dataset, and
`data/digitized/` is empty. There is therefore no experimental data in this
project to fit, and none is invented here and passed off as real.

What this module provides instead is a synthetic generator with a KNOWN ground
truth, which supports two legitimate uses:

  1. a self-consistency check on the fitting machinery: given data produced by a
     model, does the estimator recover the parameters that produced it, and are
     the reported confidence intervals honest?
  2. a structural identifiability test: can the printed four-parameter Eq. 4 be
     estimated at all from data of the type and density the paper's own Methods
     describe?

Neither is validation against experiment, and no figure or table produced from
this module may be labelled as such. Every output carries a SYNTHETIC tag.

The noise model follows the datasets in data/manifests/datasets.csv: additive
Gaussian noise on log10 CFU/mL (plating error is multiplicative on the count
scale), left-censoring at a limit of detection, and replicate plating.
